# Introduction of intended use for code and csv data files

# File structure and use of each file
The package contains 2 code folders:
- The plots_generate folder generates all plots used in the report. It runs on a single train_data.csv that was 
extracted from the original dataset (80% of the rows from the pre-processed dataset was randomly chosen). 
- The k_fold_CV folder perform all necessary operations to generate evaluation scores. No plot is generated from 
this code file to avoid unnecessary operations that may cause timeout error. 

Each folder contains 4 code files:
- main.py
- pre_processs.py
- feature_select.py
- modelling.py
The files in each folders are slightly modified to fit the folder's objective.

# Instructions on how to run your code.
- To generate the plots, open the terminal and enter the following commands:
    cd /home/plots_generate
    python main.py
- To generate evaluation scores, open the terminal and enter the following commands:
    cd /home/k_fold_CV
    python main.py

# Any additional requirements needed to run code.
